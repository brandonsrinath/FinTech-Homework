## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Solving the problem of people in lower income ranges not being able to invest easily because it may not seem feasable. With microinvesting it is much easier to invest small amounts that are rounded up everytime you use your card. It also promotes a habit of savings, I believe. 


* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
The intended customer is the low to mid level income person that wants to save money. 6.8 million customers as of February 2020, up over 2 million since last year. They offer differing risk levels of portfolios and link all of your cards are linked to round up, which other companies are not able to do. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
They use roboinvesting, microinvesting platform, roboadvising for portfolios, and algorithims.

The core metrics used are their user base, and their market cap. The company is growing exponentially year over year.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
The company is one of the top roboinvesting platforms, if not the top one.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
I would suggest they develop a platform to help people with even less money, such as homeless, to have accounts as well and be able to use this digital wallet to spend and save and be exposed to investing even at a micro level.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
This would be a seamless move into fintech charity, in a way.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Maybe a new application all together, but I feel that much of the existing platform can be used. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
These technologies are appropriate because the company basically acts as a financial institution on it's own, and they could help get accounts into the hands of people that have a cell phone, but are not able to open up an account at a physical location for various reasons (intitial fee, not able to come into bring and mortar location, monthly fee, etc.)
